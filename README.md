## What is Gopher?

Gopher is a protocol for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. It was designed at the University of Minnesota in 1991 and preceded the World Wide Web. While largely superseded by HTTP, Gopher servers still exist and offer a unique, text-focused browsing experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gopher-flutter-client.git
cd gopher-flutter-client
```

2. Get dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

1. Enter a Gopher URL in the address bar (e.g., `gopher://gopher.floodgap.com`)
2. Click "Go" or press Enter
3. Navigate through directories by clicking on items
4. Use the back/forward buttons to navigate
5. Bookmark your favorite sites
6. View your browsing history

## Example Gopher Servers

Try these popular Gopher servers:

- `gopher://gopher.floodgap.com` - Floodgap Systems
- `gopher://gopher.quux.org` - Quux.org
- `gopher://gopherpedia.com` - Gopherpedia (Wikipedia mirror)
- `gopher://gopher.club` - Gopher Club

## Architecture

The app is structured as follows:

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Data models (GopherItem, GopherAddress)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Business logic (GopherClient, StorageService, AppState)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/         # Full-page screens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/         # Reusable UI components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart        # App entry point
```

### Key Components

- **GopherClient**: Handles TCP socket connections and Gopher protocol communication
- **AppState**: State management using Provider pattern
- **StorageService**: Persistent storage for bookmarks and history using SharedPreferences
- **GopherItem**: Parses and represents Gopher menu items
